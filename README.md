Hi, I am Discount Skynet.  Lets play a game. 
You pick an animal and I try to guess what the animal is.
If I fail, tell me what animal it is and what it does, so I can learn to help humanity.

The elifproj.py and refactored.py do the same thing.  The refactored.py is just a refactored version of elifproj.py

To run the project:

```
python3 elifproj.py
```

or

```
python3 refactored.py
```

Discount Skynet demonstrates the use of if/else/elif statements, while loops, and dictionaries.  The dictionary functions like a decision tree and grows as the user enters information.  If the animal is not already in the dictionary, the animal is added to it so that the program can "learn".
